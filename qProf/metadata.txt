name=qProf
description=Calculates height and slope profiles from DEM and GPX files, and plots geological attitudes and traces on profiles.
about=qProf is a plugin for the generation of topographic and geological profiles. Topography can be extracted from DEM or GPX files. Geological data, such as stratification attitude and geological traces, can be projected on the profile. Intersections between geological outcrops or faults can be determined.
